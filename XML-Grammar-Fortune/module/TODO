* Make sure the RELAX NG validation reports line numbers for the problems
it sees (is this a limitation of XML::LibXML or libxml2 ?).

* Implement the <quote> fortune type.
    - for a quotation along with attribution, URL, etc.

* Implement the <screenplay> (or <play> perhaps) fortune type.

* Document the grammar.

* Add more tags:
    - XHTML tags: a, b, i, strong, em, 
    - <url> tag for self-enclosing URL.

* Render the information in the <info> element in a better way using the 
stylesheet.
