  <rindolf>  This reminds me of a fun discussion I had with my co-worker.
  <rindolf>  He had a Firefox window open with an ActiveState page and I
             read "Perl, PHP, Python, Tcl, XSLT".
  <rindolf>  So he said: "Heresy! C is the only language."
  <rindolf>  So I thought for a moment and said "Intercal is the only
             language."
 <nanonyme>  lol
  <rindolf>  And then "Real men write in Intercal."
  <rindolf>  "COME FROM" anyone?

 <f00li5h>  so now wikipedia is a verb?
 <rindolf>  f00li5h: it's gonna enter the OED.
 <rindolf>  f00li5h: in English every verb can be nounified and every noun
            can be verbed
