0.0513  2014-08-20
        - Remove an isa => type due to it being a plain class name which

0.0510  2013-05-03
        - Made the minimum version of perl as 5.014 due to test
        failures:
            - http://www.cpantesters.org/cpan/report/9be091a6-b278-11e2-97df-5468c1508286

0.0507  2013-01-20
        - Pass the xslt_params to the translation (and require
        XML::GrammarBase v0.2.0).

0.0506  2013-01-13
        - Fix the << has '+module_base' >> to be a dist name (with -s)
        instead of a module name (with ::).

0.0505  2013-01-13
        - Fix the output_mode parameter and better document it.
            - Fix some test failures.
            - Thanks to Anreas Koenig for some debugging assitance.

        - Fix https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=82510
            - Test suite takes forever to run due to loading DTDs from
            the W3C site, which is throttled.
            - Thanks to SREZIC for the report and analysis.

0.0503  2013-01-06
        - Convert lib/XML/Grammar/Fortune/ToText.pm to
        <<use MooX 'late'>> .
        - Removed bin/web-feed-synicate.pl - it was superseded by
        http://metacpan.org/module/XML::Grammar::Fortune::Synd::App .

0.0502  2013-01-06
        - Add t/00basic.t (for libxml2 diagnosis) and set the minimum
        XML::LibXML version to 2.0014, to avoid test failures.

0.0501  2013-01-03
        - Convert lib/XML/Grammar/Fortune.pm to XML::GrammarBase .

0.0500  2011-04-22
        - Add support for the <italics> tag to the screenplay.
        - Fix the rendering of <bold> and <italics> inside a <screenplay>
        fortune as text.
        - Clarified the license and POD of XML::Grammar::Fortune::ToText .
        and XML::Grammar::Fortune .
        - Add a more meaningful synposis to XML::Grammar::Fortune::ToText.

0.0400  2010-10-21
        - Squash spaces in the text output of the <info /> fields like
        <work /> , <author />, etc. This was a bug that caused that such tags
        with newlines would render improperly in fortunes.
        - Converted to use File::ShareDir for the extradata directory.
        This was done per the advice given here:
            - http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.module.build/2010/10/msg2765.html .
        - Many refactorings in lib/XML/Grammar/Fortune/ToText.pm .

0.0300  2010-09-25
        - Add support for text-rendering of the Screenplay-XML <inlinedesc>
        tag, so it will now render as '[' ... ']' inside the paragraphs.
        - Add the tag-release.pl file to tag a release to the Subversion
        repository.

0.0200  2010-01-21
        - Fixed some validation errors in the XSLT stylesheet that caused
        the Firefox and Opera browser to give up with an error.
            - <xsl:call-template /> cannot operate on an <xsl:value-of />
                or have a select="." attribute.
            - <xsl:apply-templates /> has a mode="..." attribute instead
            of a name="..." attribute.
        - Now the conversion-to-text supports more tags and elements
        that were previously mis-handled (with tests).
        - Add keywords to the META.yml.

0.0109  2009-10-31
        - Fixed the tests if XML-LibXSLT generates indented XML.
            - as is the case on Mandriva Cooker and other systems.
            - http://nntp.x.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/5800617
            - was done by removing indentation from both places.

0.0108  2009-03-04
        - Sorted out the installation of the extradata elements.

0.0107  2009-03-03
        - converted Build.PL to inc/XML/Grammar/Builder.pm .

0.0106  2009-02-16
        - set the minimum version of perl that can compile this module,
        to perl-5.8.x as it requires some ":utf8" stuff, and fails on
        perl-5.6.x:
            - http://nntp.x.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/3301395

0.0105  2009-02-14
        - avoided creating an xmlns="" attribute in the output of several
        elements which caused the XHTML to be invalid.

0.0104  2008-08-21
        - Removed a binmode ":utf8" call from t/to-xhtml.t to settle
        XML-LibXML on Mandriva Cooker and elsewhere.
            - see https://qa.mandriva.com/show_bug.cgi?id=41993

0.0103  2008-08-02
        - "documented" open in lib/XML/Grammar/Fortune.pm due to its
        use Fatal call to settle t/pod-coverage.t.

0.0102  2008-07-31
        - Converted create_makefile_pl from "traditional" to
        "passthrough" so it will run Build.PL and avoid the various
        problems inherent in depending on the Makefile.PL generation.
        - Hopefully it will silence CPAN Testers warnings such as:
            - http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2008/07/msg1958808.html

0.0101  2008-07-25
        - Added the _data_dir() to the XSLT - it was an installation
        copy-and-paste bug.

0.01    2008-07-16
        - First version - implementing IRC conversations, <quote>,
        <screenplay> and raw messages.
        - No "human-friendly" documentation for the XML format, but there's
        a Relax NG, and comprehensive examples, both for testing
        and on http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/ .
