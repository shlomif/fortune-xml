        - Add support for the <italics> tag to the screenplay.
        - Fix the rendering of <bold> and <italics> inside a <screenplay>
        fortune as text.
        - Clarified the license and POD of XML::Grammar::Fortune::ToText .
        and XML::Grammar::Fortune .

        - Squash spaces in the text output of the <info /> fields like
        <work /> , <author />, etc. This was a bug that caused that such tags
        with newlines would render improperly in fortunes.
        - Converted to use File::ShareDir for the extradata directory.
        This was done per the advice given here:
            - http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.module.build/2010/10/msg2765.html .
        - Many refactorings in lib/XML/Grammar/Fortune/ToText.pm .

        - Add support for text-rendering of the Screenplay-XML <inlinedesc>
        tag, so it will now render as '[' ... ']' inside the paragraphs.
        - Add the tag-release.pl file to tag a release to the Subversion
        repository.

        - Fixed some validation errors in the XSLT stylesheet that caused
        the Firefox and Opera browser to give up with an error.
            - <xsl:call-template /> cannot operate on an <xsl:value-of />
                or have a select="." attribute.
            - <xsl:apply-templates /> has a mode="..." attribute instead
            of a name="..." attribute.
        - Now the conversion-to-text supports more tags and elements
        that were previously mis-handled (with tests).
        - Add keywords to the META.yml.

        - Fixed the tests if XML-LibXSLT generates indented XML.
            - as is the case on Mandriva Cooker and other systems.
            - http://nntp.x.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/5800617
            - was done by removing indentation from both places.

        - Sorted out the installation of the extradata elements.

        - converted Build.PL to inc/XML/Grammar/Builder.pm .

        - set the minimum version of perl that can compile this module,
        to perl-5.8.x as it requires some ":utf8" stuff, and fails on
        perl-5.6.x:

        - avoided creating an xmlns="" attribute in the output of several
        elements which caused the XHTML to be invalid.

0.0104  Thu Aug 21 17:39:45 IDT 2008
        - Removed a binmode ":utf8" call from t/to-xhtml.t to settle
        XML-LibXML on Mandriva Cooker and elsewhere.
            - see https://qa.mandriva.com/show_bug.cgi?id=41993

        - "documented" open in lib/XML/Grammar/Fortune.pm due to its
        use Fatal call to settle t/pod-coverage.t.

0.0102  Thu Jul 31 15:58:08 IDT 2008
        - Converted create_makefile_pl from "traditional" to
        "passthrough" so it will run Build.PL and avoid the various
        problems inherent in depending on the Makefile.PL generation.
        - Hopefully it will silence CPAN Testers warnings such as:

        - Added the _data_dir() to the XSLT - it was an installation
        copy-and-paste bug.

        - First version - implementing IRC conversations, <quote>,
        <screenplay> and raw messages.
        - No "human-friendly" documentation for the XML format, but there's
        a Relax NG, and comprehensive examples, both for testing
        and on http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/ .
