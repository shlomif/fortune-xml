        - set the minimum version of perl that can compile this module,
        to perl-5.8.x as it requires some ":utf8" stuff, and fails on
        perl-5.6.x:

        - avoided creating an xmlns="" attribute in the output of several
        elements which caused the XHTML to be invalid.

        - Removed a binmode ":utf8" call from t/to-xhtml.t to settle

        - Converted create_makefile_pl from "traditional" to 
        "passthrough" so it will run Build.PL and avoid the various
        problems inherent in depending on the Makefile.PL generation.
        - Hopefully it will silence CPAN Testers warnings such as:

        - First version - implementing IRC conversations, <quote>,
        <screenplay> and raw messages.

        a Relax NG, and comprehensive examples, both for testing
        and on http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/ .
