        - Convert the write-to directories in t/*.t to File::Temp's tempdir() ,
        in order to get rid of Win32 (and other) test failures:

        - Eliminate old IDs in the YAML file if the fortune cookies were moved
        or deleted.

        - Reformat "Changes" (this file) - it had some long lines.
        - Added MANIFEST.SKIP to the distribution. It's not functional yet,
        but it keep getting auto-generated (we maintain the MANIFEST manually).
        - Added a dependency on XML-Grammar-Fortune-0.0400 which was converted
        to File-ShareDir, and so this module will now hopefully not fail the
        tests.

        - Add List::Util (which is core, but is still explicitly used) and
        XML::RSS version 1.46 to the dependencies.
        - Revamped lib/XML/Grammar/Fortune/Synd.pm - the RSS feed is now
        generated side-by-side with the Atom feed instead of converted from
        it. This makes sure that the RSS feed is now fixed and does not
        contain weird base-64 encoded data. However, the Atom feed is still
        broken, due to this bug in XML-Atom:
            - https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=61637
        - Test for the RSS correctness in t/01-run.t .
        - Add the tag-release.pl script to tag release in the svn repository.
